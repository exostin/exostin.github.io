## About me

> I always wanted to be a programmer.

From an early age, I was surrounded by games and technology, always fascinated by the possibility of creating my own software. 
I am self-taught, I started by trial and error with very simple applications in C++, then automation of tasks in Python, and finally I turned to create games in Unity engine using C# language.
I've worked on two game projects in an international team. I'm currently a team leader and a developer in a group of ten for a Polish game making championship - Turniej Tr√≥jgamiczny!
My main goal is to grow in the game development industry.
